To do this I am building transmission potential networks based on shared land use and spatial connectivity, then testing if connected individuals are infected with similar suites of parasites. I am also testing if interventions in one species affect other species' infection status by vaccinating dogs against Leptospirosis, a globally distributed zoonotic disease.
