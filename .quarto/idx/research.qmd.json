Humans are most commonly exposed to the *Leptospira* bacterium through contact with the urine of an infected animal, such as a dog or rat, either directly, or indirectly through contaminated water. During *Leptospira* outbreaks, a commonly recommended public health measure to prevent human infections is to vaccinate dogs, however, the efficacy of this measure has never been tested.\n\n**Does vaccinating dogs against *Leptospira* lower infection prevalence in humans and rats?** To answer this question, we vaccinated \\>75% of dogs living in a rural village in Madagascar against *Leptospira,* then monitored dogs, humans, and small mammals living in that village over the next year.

How important are landscape level risk metrics versus environmental risk metrics in predicting realized risk in humans? Is quantifying the landscape of risk a useful metric for assessing spillover risk?\n\nTo answer these questions I am working across a suite of samples from small mammals, bats, domestic animals, and people living and working along a habitat degradation gradient in rural northeastern Madagascar. Habitat degradation alters the ecological communities and the pathogen pressure exerted by the transformed landscape, thus altering patterns multi-host parasite sharing. I use infection data and environmental trait to build models of \"landscape-level\" risk of these various habitat types, then overlay high-resolution GPS tracker data from people to quantify their exposure risk.
