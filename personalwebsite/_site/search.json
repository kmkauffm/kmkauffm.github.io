    "text": "Research Interests\nDisease Ecology ⚬ One Health\nMy academic interests lie at the intersection of wildlife, ecosystem, domestic animal, and human health. This intrigue is borne from my experiences learning about animal agriculture as an undergraduate, researching diseases of wildlife and natural resource management as a master’s student, and independently traveling and volunteering in countries where zoonotic disease and deforestation are acute challenges. I am particularly focused on testing efforts to identify data-driven interventions to prevent or mitigate the spread of emerging or re-emerging zoonoses. I aim to become a leader in the intersectional field of One Health by working to inform scientifically based low-cost solutions to neglected tropical diseases, particularly zoonotic diseases. A major part of my research involves applying perturbations or interventions to short-circuit disease transmission or emergence; I believe that there are many opportunities to deliver effective and efficient public health interventions that are rooted in healthy, functioning ecological systems. In my career, I aim to help close the implementation gap between theoretical and applied disease control measures by experimentally evaluating theoretical findings in real-world multi-host-pathogen systems.\nMy Ph.D. research is deeply embedded in One Health. I am working to understand how human-induced environmental changes transform the infectious disease risk landscape for wildlife, domestic animals, and people living on the edge of a Marojejy National Park in rural northeastern Madagascar. To do this I am building transmission potential networks based on shared land use and spatial connectivity, then testing if connected individuals are infected with similar suites of parasites. I am also testing if interventions in one species affect other species’ infection status by vaccinating dogs against Leptospirosis, a globally distributed zoonotic disease. While I am familiar with using spatial (GPS and satellite), basic statistical, and bench laboratory techniques needed for this project, I am in need of more robust modeling and statistical analysis toolsets to accomplish the aims of these projects."

    "text": "Leptospirosis is a globally distributed disease, which disproportionately affects impoverished communities such as subsistence farmers. Humans are most commonly exposed to the Leptospira bacterium through contact with the urine of an infected animal, such as a dog or rat, either directly, or indirectly through contaminated water. During Leptospira outbreaks, a commonly recommended public health measure to prevent human infections is to vaccinate dogs, however, the efficacy of this measure has never been tested.\nDoes vaccinating dogs against Leptospira lower infection prevalence in humans and rats? To answer this question, we vaccinated &gt;75% of dogs living in a rural village in Madagascar against Leptospira, then monitored dogs, humans, and small mammals living in that village over the next year. I am also approaching this question from a theoretical standpoint using SIR and agent-based models to understand the mechanism by which the vaccination campaign impacted community- and individual-level prevalence of Leptospira infections.\nSee my ESA 2023 poster presentation on our initial finding here\n\n\n\n\nHow closely do “landscape of risk” metrics of human and domestic animal exposures map to realized risk (infections) in humans and other incidental hosts across a suite of parasites? How important are landscape level risk metrics versus environmental risk metrics in predicting realized risk in humans? Is quantifying the landscape of risk a useful metric for assessing spillover risk?\nTo answer these questions I am working across a suite of samples from small mammals, bats, domestic animals, and people living and working along a habitat degradation gradient in rural northeastern Madagascar. Habitat degradation alters the ecological communities and the pathogen pressure exerted by the transformed landscape, thus altering patterns multi-host parasite sharing. I use infection data and environmental trait to build models of “landscape-level” risk of these various habitat types, then overlay high-resolution GPS tracker data from people to quantify their exposure risk. Then use infection data from the same people to test if that risk translates into a higher probability of infection.\n\n\n\n\nAs part of the team effort to understand the ecological, social, and environmental determinants of disease in 3 communities in rural northeastern Madagascar, I build networks connecting people and animals to each other and their shared environments. The first results of this work were reported in Kauffman et. al, 2022 and Evans et. al, 2023 used these networks to simulated COVID-19 testing strategies in a resource-poor setting."

I used archeived samples to compare the distributions of genotypes of this virus across its range, as a first step towards explaining the observed differences in disease severity. I also studied maternal transmission of the virus in mule deer, to further our understanding of how the virus is maintained in a population and its potential impacts on neonates (Kauffman et. al, 2020)."
